# Alternative File-Based Trial Settings

## New Approach Implemented

Instead of relying solely on database storage, the system now uses a hybrid approach:

1. **Primary**: Try database/MongoDB storage
2. **Fallback**: Use file-based storage (`trial-settings.json`)

## How It Works

### When Saving Settings
1. First tries to save via storage (MongoDB/Memory)
2. If storage fails, saves to `trial-settings.json` file
3. Always returns success if either method works

### When Loading Settings  
1. First tries to load from storage
2. If storage fails, loads from `trial-settings.json`
3. If no file exists, returns default settings

## Benefits

- **Reliability**: Always works regardless of database issues
- **Persistence**: Settings persist across container restarts
- **VPS Compatible**: Works in any Docker environment
- **No Dependencies**: Doesn't require specific database configuration

## Testing

The new implementation will:
- Show detailed logs for troubleshooting
- Gracefully handle all error scenarios
- Provide consistent API responses

Trial settings should now save successfully on VPS regardless of MongoDB connection status.
