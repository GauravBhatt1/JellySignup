# Final VPS Deployment Commands

## Your Docker build is successful! 

The warning message is normal. Here are the commands to complete deployment:

### 1. Check if container is running:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

### 2. If container is not running, start it:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Check container logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f jellyfin-signup
```

### 4. Test the application:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

### 5. Access your application:
- Main app: http://your-vps-ip:5000
- Admin panel: http://your-vps-ip:5000/admin

### If you need to rebuild (only if changes made):
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

## Container Status Check Script
Run this to check everything at once:
```bash
./check-container.sh
```

Your Docker build completed successfully - the application should now be accessible on port 5000.
