# Hybrid Trial Management Solution

## Implementation Complete

### Trial Settings
- **Primary**: MongoDB/Database storage
- **Fallback**: File-based storage (`trial-settings.json`)
- **Result**: Always saves, regardless of database issues

### Trial Users  
- **Primary**: MongoDB storage (works perfectly on VPS)
- **Fallback**: File-based storage (`trial-users.json`)
- **Integration**: Seamless between storage methods

### User Signup Process
1. Creates Jellyfin user
2. Checks trial settings (storage → file fallback)
3. If trial enabled, creates trial user (storage → file fallback)
4. Tracks user location and access

### VPS Compatibility
- MongoDB connection issues won't break functionality
- File persistence across container restarts
- Consistent API responses
- No manual intervention required

### Testing
Trial settings should now save successfully on VPS regardless of MongoDB connection status. The system automatically handles storage failures gracefully.
